week 1 practice

Results:
	Being inspired of Josef Albers, the great artist focus on the study of color and recognition and have great amount of works dealing with geometry expecially rectangles, I created the interactive piece to play with colorful rectangles.
	A rectangle with a specific color(which is based on the position of mouse) will be drawn when the mouse click on the screen. The mouse position determines one of the four corners of the rectangle.
Learned: 
	1. write basic interactive piece with mouse position
	2. use the mouse position as a parameter to generate color and size.
